 * `<attempt_completion>`, …) and parse the model's output with a
 * regex tuned to that exact shape. When dario's default mode

 * wrapper — which is well-formed for a CC-tool request but
 * unparseable for a text-protocol client, so every edit surfaces as
 * an error in the client UI even though the model produced a valid
 * response (dario#40, reported by @ringge).
 *
 * The fix is preserve-tools behavior: skip the CC tool swap so the
 * model sees the client's own schema and emits its native XML shape.
 * Auto-detection saves users from having to discover the
 * `--preserve-tools` flag exists; the flag is still honored as an
 * explicit override and `--hybrid-tools` outranks detection.
 *
 * Detection must run BEFORE `scrubFrameworkIdentifiers` so brand
 * names like "Cline" / "Roo" are still present. Tool-protocol
 * markers are scrub-proof on their own.
 *
 * Returns the matched family (`cline` / `kilo` / `roo` / `cline-like` /
 * `hermes`) or null when no signature is present.

 * it uses the standard Anthropic JSON tool-use protocol (not XML). But it
 * ships ~40 tools, 15+ of which have no CC equivalent (browser_*, vision_*,
 * image_generate, text_to_speech, skills_*, memory, session_search,
 * cronjob, send_message, ha_*, mixture_of_agents, delegate_task, …). In
 * default mode dario distributes unmapped tools onto random CC slots which
 * silently misroutes them. preserve-tools is the correct default for
 * Hermes for the same outcome as Cline (client's tool schema passes
 * through untouched) even though the reason is different. The function

  //
  // We drop the mappings rather than remap to Task* because the semantics

/**
 * Streaming reverse-mapper for SSE responses.
 *
 * The non-streaming reverse-map can rewrite tool_use input in one pass
 * because it sees the whole `input` object. SSE streaming arrives in
 * three phases per tool_use block:
 *
 *   content_block_start  → carries `tool_use.name` and `tool_use.input: {}`
 *   content_block_delta  → carries `input_json_delta.partial_json` chunks
 *                          that, concatenated, form the full input JSON
 *   content_block_stop   → end of the block
 *
 * To rewrite the parameter shape we need the FULL input, which only
 * exists at content_block_stop. So for tool_use blocks that need
 * translation, we:
 *
 *   1. Forward content_block_start with the rewritten name (so clients
 *      see their own tool name immediately and can start tracking it)
 *   2. Swallow content_block_delta events for that block, accumulating
 *      partial_json into a per-block buffer
 *   3. On content_block_stop, parse the accumulated input, apply
 *      translateBack, and emit ONE synthetic content_block_delta with
 *      the full translated input as a single partial_json string,
 *      followed by the original content_block_stop event
 *
 * Trade-off: clients that consume tool_use input as it streams (rare
 * but possible) will see the input arrive as a single chunk at the
 * end of the block instead of streaming character-by-character. For
 * tool_use that's acceptable — input is usually small (<1KB) and the
 * alternative is parameter-shape mismatch causing validation errors.
 *
 * For tool_use blocks that DON'T have a translateBack mapping (or
 * aren't in the reverseMap at all), the streaming mapper passes the
 * original SSE bytes through unchanged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   const mapper = createStreamingReverseMapper(toolMap);
 *   for await (const chunk of upstream) res.write(mapper.feed(chunk));
 *   const tail = mapper.end();
 *   if (tail.length) res.write(tail);
