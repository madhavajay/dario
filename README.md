**Anthropic ships restrictions to subscribers through wire-shape changes that don't appear in any user-facing changelog. dario makes them visible.** A three-class drift watcher catches each silent change — new CC binaries, in-version remote-config changes, and classifier-rule shifts — auto-opens a fix PR with a unified diff inline, and the public record names what shifted and when. The proxy keeps your subscription doing what it did yesterday until you choose otherwise. Receipts below.

You're already paying $20, $100, or $200 a month for Claude. Then Cursor wants an API key. Aider wants an API key. Cline, Continue, Zed, your scripts — every one of them bills you **again**, per token, while the subscription you already bought sits idle in Claude Code.

**dario is one local endpoint that routes all of them through the Claude subscription you already pay for.** Point any Anthropic- or OpenAI-compatible tool at `http://localhost:3456` and you're done. No per-tool config, no second bill.

```bash
npm install -g @askalf/dario
dario login          # uses your existing Claude Code credentials
dario proxy          # start the server (separate terminal or background)
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dario
```

That's the whole setup. Every tool that honors those env vars now runs on your subscription.

**New in v4:** type `dario` (no args) in another terminal to open the interactive TUI — live request stream, per-model burn-rate, rate-limit utilization, and a config editor that writes to `~/.dario/config.json`. Migrating from v3? See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

**New in v4.1 — overage-guard:** dario halts itself the moment a single response carries `representative-claim: overage` and returns 503 with a clean error body until you run `dario resume` or the cooldown clears. Subscribers should never see an overage hit during normal operation; one means something is wrong, and continuing to forward requests bleeds against per-token billing. Active protection by default; flip to warn-only with `--overage-behavior=warn` or off entirely with `--no-overage-guard`.

## The money

| Setup | Monthly cost — heavy user |
|---|---|
| Cursor + Anthropic API direct | **$80–$300** |
| Multi-tool heavy use (Cursor + Aider + Cline + Continue), per-token | **$200–$600+** |
| **Any of the above + dario** | **$20–$200 flat** — your existing Pro/Max plan, nothing extra |

Switching providers is a model-name change, not a reconfigure: `claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-4o`, `llama-3.3-70b`, anything on OpenRouter/Groq/Ollama. Add a backend once (`dario backend add openai --key=…`) and the same `localhost:3456` speaks OpenAI too.

---

## The deadline: 2026-06-15

On **2026-06-15**, Anthropic splits Claude billing in two. Agentic traffic — Agent SDK, `claude -p` headless — stops counting against your subscription pool and gets a separate small monthly credit. [Announced 2026-05-13](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan) via Claude's Help Center and a [@ClaudeDevs X post](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2054610152817619388) — no anthropic.com blog post, no email to most subscribers, no mention in CC release notes.

| Plan | New Agent-SDK / `claude -p` credit | When it runs out |
|---|---|---|
| Pro | $20/mo | extra-usage at API rates **only if enabled**; otherwise suspended until renewal |
| Max 5x | $100/mo | same |
| Max 20x | $200/mo | same |

A sustained Cline or Aider session burns $100 of API-rate tokens in an evening. **Any proxy that forwards requests in their original `claude -p` / Agent-SDK shape — which is most of them — dumps your agentic traffic into that small credit bucket, then onto metered pricing.**

dario doesn't. Every outbound request is rebuilt into **interactive Claude Code wire-shape** before it leaves your machine — headers, body key order, TLS stack, session-id lifecycle, and (v3.38+, `--stealth`) the temporal axis: response-correlated think-time and session-start latency. Anthropic's billing classifier sees an interactive Claude Code session. Your traffic stays in the subscription pool you already pay for.

| Your setup | After 2026-06-15 |
|---|---|
| Any tool → Anthropic API direct | per-token API |
| Any tool → proxy that forwards requests as-is | **$20–200/mo credit, then per-token (or suspended)** |
| **Any tool → dario** | **subscription pool — unchanged** |
| Claude Code, interactive | subscription pool — unchanged |

Same install, same `localhost:3456`, no config change for the cliff. Verify on your own machine: `dario doctor --usage` fires one request and surfaces the rate-limit headers — `representative-claim` should read `five_hour` or `seven_day` (subscription buckets). Full breakdown: [`docs/why-now-2026-06.md`](./docs/why-now-2026-06.md).

---

## The principle dario operates on

Two layers, separated:

1. **Tiered pricing is fine.** Anthropic can charge differently for first-party use vs. third-party use. Every SaaS does this.
2. **Hiding the tier from the customer is not.** When the public docs page says "1M context available on Sonnet/Opus" but the auth layer rejects every attempt to access it on the OAuth path most subscribers use — when the billing classifier silently flips your request to overage without saying which signal triggered it — that's information asymmetry weaponized into product design.

OpenAI does this cleanly: ChatGPT Plus is a chat product, the API is a separate metered product, you choose. Anthropic uses one URL and a hidden classifier. **dario's job is to make the classifier visible.**

We don't bypass auth. We don't fake who you are. We replay the exact wire shape Claude Code emits — captured live from your installed binary — so the classifier sees what it expects. That's a transparency tool, not a circumvention tool. Your subscription is doing what your subscription does; you're authenticating as you.

This is also why every dario release ships receipts: the [eight-signal classifier table](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/13), the [drift watch records](.github/workflows/cc-drift-watch.yml), the auto-PR history. Anthropic doesn't publish what their classifier reads. dario does.

## What Anthropic shipped this month. What dario shipped same-day.

The 2026-06-15 split is announced. The wire-shape changes that arrive between releases are not. This is the cadence:

**Claude Code v2.1.142 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog), 2026-05-14)** — itemizes a Fast-mode default change, MCP timeout fixes, plugin path fixes, terminal display tweaks, a stale model-name removal. Says **nothing** about these three wire-shape changes that landed in the same release:

| What changed in v2.1.142 (silent) | Effect on subscribers | dario detected | dario shipped |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context-1m-2025-08-07` dropped from default `anthropic-beta` header set, and the beta is categorically rejected on OAuth subscription auth | Subscription users lose >200K context on Sonnet/Opus. Anthropic docs at [platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) still list 1M context as available for these models with no OAuth caveat. | hourly drift watcher | v3.38.3 (re-bake) + v3.38.4 (compat range) — 2026-05-14/15 |
| `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` gated per-model server-side — only Opus/Sonnet 4-6+ accept; older 4-5 models 400 with `"adaptive thinking is not supported on this model"` | Anyone targeting Sonnet 4-5 or Opus 4-5 through any proxy 400s every request until they remove the field | live-probe matrix (this session) | **v3.38.5** — published 2026-05-15T21:20:22Z ([PR #273](https://github.com/askalf/dario/pull/273)) |
| `TodoWrite` / `TodoRead` removed from the tool catalog; replaced by the `Task*` family (TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, TaskOutput, TaskStop, TaskUpdate) — no migration note | Any client that hardcoded the `todo_*` names now sends tools the server doesn't recognize | template re-bake | **v3.38.6** — published 2026-05-15T21:33:44Z ([PR #274](https://github.com/askalf/dario/pull/274)) |

**Three undisclosed wire-shape changes in one CC release. Three dario releases the same evening, 13 minutes apart.** The interactive Claude Code TUI is what makes this visible to you in real time — Hits tab shows the request shape going out, the rate-limit bucket coming back, and dario's auto-retry decision in between. v4.0.0 went live 2026-05-16T11:46:01Z; the drift cadence is the same as it's been since v3.22.

**Then it got worse.** v4.2.1 (2026-05-17) shipped receipts for a more aggressive class: **same CC binary, different wire output 24 hours apart.** Same `claude.exe` on disk that produced template A yesterday produces template B today — three slot diffs in one 24h window (`output_config.effort` default flipped `medium` → `high` → `xhigh`, `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta back in the header set, system_prompt -354 chars), zero changelog entries from Anthropic, no npm version bump anywhere. Anthropic ships wire-shape changes through CC's **remote configuration**, not just through CC npm releases.

**Three classes of drift, three watchers, all auto-detecting and auto-PR'ing.**

- **Class A — npm-release drift.** [`cc-drift-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-watch.yml) (cron `0 * * * *`) catches each new CC npm release on a github-hosted runner. [`cc-drift-auto-release.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-auto-release.yml) merges and ships within minutes.
- **Class B — same-binary remote-config drift** *(v4.2.2)*. [`cc-drift-template-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-template-watch.yml) (cron `*/30 * * * *`) runs on a self-hosted runner with an authenticated CC install, captures live every 30 min. On detection, **opens an auto-rebake PR** *(v4.4.0)* with the freshly-baked template and a unified-line diff inline *(v4.5.0)* — a reviewer sees ship-or-investigate in one screen. This is the only way to catch the class — github-hosted has no Pro/Max session, no OAuth credential, no way to capture from real CC. Setup: [`docs/drift-monitor.md`](./docs/drift-monitor.md).
- **Class C — classifier-rule drift** *(v4.6.0)*. [`cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml) sends one live request through dario's canonical-rebuild mode daily, asserts the `representative-claim` response header still maps to a subscription bucket. Catches the orthogonal failure mode where CC's wire shape is unchanged but Anthropic's classifier rules shifted underneath.
- **PR-time compat gate** *(v4.3.0)*. [`compat-test-self-hosted.yml`](./.github/workflows/compat-test-self-hosted.yml) runs the full compat suite against a live `dario proxy` on every PR that touches the wire-shape surface — regressions fail the merge check **before** they ship.
- **Liveness alarm** *(v4.4.2)*. [`cc-drift-watcher-liveness.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-watcher-liveness.yml) runs on github-hosted infra every 2 hours, alerts if the self-hosted class-B watcher hasn't had a successful run in 3 hours. Watches the watcher; survives the exact failure modes it's designed to detect.

**Anthropic doesn't publish a wire-level changelog for subscribers. dario is one.**

## What the billing classifier actually does

[Discussion #13](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/13) documents eight binary signals identified via MITM capture + binary RE + controlled A/B testing with a real Max 5x subscriber. The classifier is rule-based, not ML — transitions are sharp; same input flips to the same output 100% of the time across 6 A/B trials:

| Signal | Claude Code value | Non-CC value |
|---|---|---|
| `output_config.effort` | `medium` (CC default) | other → reclassified |
| `max_tokens` | `64000` | other → reclassified |
| `thinking` shape | `{type: "adaptive"}` *(per-model — see drift table above)* | `{enabled, budget_tokens: N}` → reclassified |
| System prompt block count | exactly 3 | other → reclassified |
| Tool names | `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, … (CC's set) | non-CC names → reclassified |
| Per-request billing tag | rolling SHA-256 | missing/static → reclassified |
| JSON field order | specific stable order | different → reclassified |
| Non-CC body fields (`temperature`, `top_p`, `service_tier`) | absent | present → reclassified |

[Discussion #178](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/178) reproduces an additional fingerprint that operates on commit metadata: Anthropic's classifier fires on the literal namespaced string `openclaw.inbound_meta.v1` in recent git commits — the kind of identifier that would only appear in code integrating with a specific competitor's API. Verified 22 hours after [Theo posted on X](https://x.com/theo/status/2049645973350363168) with four diagnostic test variants. Same JSON shape with a different namespace name doesn't trigger. dario's template replay protects users from this filter because the git context never reaches `api.anthropic.com` — only dario's captured CC template does.

Reclassification flips the request from `five_hour` (your subscription) to `overage` (per-token). On accounts without overage credit enabled, the request hard-fails with `400: "You're out of extra usage."` — a message that's, charitably, hard to debug if you didn't know your traffic was being reclassified in the first place.

---

## What dario does when overage lands (v4.1)

v4 made the billing bucket visible per-request in the TUI's Hits tab. v4.1 turns that visibility into active protection.

The moment any upstream response carries `representative-claim: overage`, dario **halts the proxy**. Every subsequent `/v1/messages`, `/v1/complete`, `/v1/chat/completions` request returns `503` with an Anthropic-shaped error body the client surfaces verbatim:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "dario_overage_guard",
    "message": "dario halted to prevent API-rate bleed. A request was classified as 'overage' (per-token billing) instead of your subscription pool. To resume: run `dario resume` in another terminal, or wait until <ISO ts> for the cooldown to auto-clear. Details: github.com/askalf/dario/issues/288"
  }
}
```

The state surfaces in four TUI tabs simultaneously — each answers a different question a user has when their bill suddenly starts moving:

| Tab | Question it answers | What it renders |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | What's happening RIGHT NOW? | `⚠ HALTED` banner with triggering request, cause, live countdown to auto-resume, manual-resume hint |
| **Hits** | Which specific request triggered it? | Pinned banner across the top + red `!` marker + red row on the triggering request in the live buffer + 503-status row for any blocked-while-halted requests |
| **Analytics** | How often is this happening across my traffic? | New "Overage" bar in the rate-limit cluster, alongside 5h/7d — red the moment count is non-zero |
| **Config** | How do I tune this? | Four in-place-editable fields: `overageGuard.enabled`, `.behavior` (enum-validated halt/warn), `.cooldownMs`, `.notifyOs` |

Status and Hits during an active halt:

```

Why "halt at hit #1" is the right default: subscribers should never see a single overage response during normal operation. One means something is wrong — wire-shape drift, classifier change, account misconfig — and continuing to forward requests in the same shape bleeds real money for accounts with extra-usage enabled, or returns wall-of-rejections for accounts without it. The first hit is the signal; the second through hundredth are damage.

**Resume paths** — `dario resume` from any shell, `R` on the TUI Status tab, or the cooldown timer (default 30 min). **Configuration** — `~/.dario/config.json` → `overageGuard`, or CLI flags (`--overage-behavior=warn` for visibility-only, `--no-overage-guard` to disable, `--overage-cooldown=<ms>` to tune). **OS notification** — best-effort native toast (osascript / notify-send / BurntToast) plus terminal BEL as the unconditional floor. See [#288](https://github.com/askalf/dario/issues/288).

**Verified end-to-end live.** [`test/overage-guard-e2e-live.mjs`](./test/overage-guard-e2e-live.mjs) patches `globalThis.fetch` to mock the upstream, starts a real dario proxy in-process, and drives the five-stage halt cycle through real HTTP: subscription request flows → upstream returns overage → guard halts → next request returns 503 with the `dario_overage_guard` body → `POST /admin/resume` clears state → requests flow again. 20/20 assertions, 3 upstream calls intercepted (the halted request short-circuited at the request handler, never touched the upstream). Run with `node test/overage-guard-e2e-live.mjs`.

## Does it actually work?

Four LLMs reviewed the codebase cold, same prompt ([`reviews/PROMPT.md`](./reviews/PROMPT.md)), each signed a verdict:

> "Not vibe-coded; it reads like production-grade infrastructure that happens to be open-source." — **Grok 4** ([full](./reviews/grok-4-2026-04-21.md))
>
> "The implementation isn't just a simple header swap; it is a sophisticated request-level deepfake." — **Gemini 2.0 Pro** ([full](./reviews/gemini-2-pro-2026-04-21.md))
>
> "Not 'best-effort mimicry'; it's capture-and-replay of a real client." — **GPT-5.3** ([full](./reviews/gpt-5.3-2026-04-21.md))
>
> "The fingerprint-replay claim is backed by the code." — **Claude Opus 4.7** ([full](./reviews/claude-opus-4-7-2026-04-21.md))

The mechanism: dario doesn't *guess* Claude Code's request shape — it captures it live from your installed `claude` binary on every startup, drift-detects against each upstream CC release, and replays it byte-for-byte. That's why the billing classifier can't tell the difference. Deep dive: [`docs/wire-fidelity.md`](./docs/wire-fidelity.md).

## 30 seconds, in full

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @askalf/dario

# 2. Log in to your Claude subscription (Pro, Max 5x, or Max 20x)
dario login                 # or `dario login --manual` for SSH / headless

# 3. Start the local proxy in one terminal
dario proxy

# 4. (Optional, recommended) Open the interactive TUI in another terminal
dario                       # tabs: Status / Config / Analytics / Hits / Accounts / Backends

# 5. Point any Anthropic-compat tool at the proxy
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dario
```

Works with: Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Cline, Roo Code, Continue.dev, Zed, Windsurf, OpenHands, OpenClaw, Hermes, Codex CLI, the [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk), your own scripts.

Add other providers and reuse the same proxy:

```bash
dario backend add openai     --key=sk-proj-...
dario backend add groq       --key=gsk_...    --base-url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
dario backend add openrouter --key=sk-or-...  --base-url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
dario backend add local      --key=anything   --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1

export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=dario
```

Force a specific backend with a model prefix: `openai:gpt-4o`, `claude:opus`, `groq:llama-3.3-70b`, `local:qwen-coder`.

Prefer Docker? `ghcr.io/askalf/dario:latest` — multi-arch (`amd64`+`arm64`), published every release. Guide: [`docs/docker.md`](./docs/docker.md).

Something off? `dario doctor` prints one paste-ready health report. Or open the TUI's Status tab.

---

## What it actually does

You point every tool at one URL. Dario reads each request, decides which backend owns it, forwards in that backend's native protocol.

| Client speaks | Model | Routes to | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Messages | `claude-*` / `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` | Claude backend | OAuth swap + CC template replay → `api.anthropic.com` |
| Anthropic Messages | `gpt-*`, `llama-*`, … | OpenAI-compat backend | Anthropic→OpenAI translation, forwarded |
| OpenAI Chat | `gpt-*` / `o1-*` / `o3-*` | OpenAI-compat backend | Auth swap, body forwarded byte-for-byte |
| OpenAI Chat | `claude-*` | Claude backend | OpenAI→Anthropic translation, then Claude path |
| Either | `<provider>:<model>` | Forced by prefix | Explicit override |

The tool doesn't know. The backend doesn't know. Dario is the seam.

## Capabilities

- **Interactive TUI (v4).** `dario` with no args opens a full-screen control panel: live request stream, per-model burn-rate, rate-limit utilization bars, billing bucket breakdown, in-place config editor that writes to `~/.dario/config.json`. The visible interface that turns subscription accounting from "log files" into "watch it happen."
- **Three-class drift detection.** [`cc-drift-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-watch.yml) catches **Class A** (new CC npm releases) hourly on a github-hosted runner — auto-drafts + auto-merges a fix PR; median CC release → dario release under one hour. [`cc-drift-template-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-template-watch.yml) *(v4.2.2)* catches **Class B** (same-binary remote-config drift — Anthropic changing wire output *without* bumping the npm version, first documented in [CHANGELOG v4.2.1](./CHANGELOG.md#421---2026-05-17)) every 30 min on a self-hosted runner with authenticated CC, **opens an auto-rebake PR** *(v4.4.0)* with a unified-line diff inline *(v4.5.0)*. [`cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml) *(v4.6.0)* catches **Class C** (Anthropic changing classifier rules — same wire shape, different billing bucket) via a daily 1-request canary. [`compat-test-self-hosted.yml`](./.github/workflows/compat-test-self-hosted.yml) *(v4.3.0)* runs the full compat suite against a live proxy on every PR that touches the wire-shape surface. [`cc-drift-watcher-liveness.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-watcher-liveness.yml) *(v4.4.2)* alarms if the class-B watcher itself goes offline. Walkthrough: [`docs/drift-monitor.md`](./docs/drift-monitor.md).
- **Multi-account pool.** Drop 2+ Claude accounts in `~/.dario/accounts/` and pool mode auto-activates: every request routes to the account with the most headroom, multi-turn sessions pin to one account so the prompt cache survives, in-flight 429s fail over to a peer before your client sees an error. `dario accounts add work` / `dario accounts add personal`. → [`docs/multi-account-pool.md`](./docs/multi-account-pool.md)
- **Behavioral stealth (`--stealth`).** Static wire fidelity covers *what* the request looks like; `--stealth` adds *when* it arrives — response-length-correlated think time and 1.2–4.2s session-start latency, the inter-arrival pattern real interactive sessions have and agent loops don't. → [`docs/wire-fidelity.md`](./docs/wire-fidelity.md)
- **Runs any non-Claude-Code agent.** A 64-entry schema-verified `TOOL_MAP` pre-maps Cline, Roo, Kilo, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Copilot, OpenHands, OpenClaw, Hermes, [hands](https://github.com/askalf/hands) tool names to CC's native set. No flag, no validator errors. → [`docs/integrations/agent-compat.md`](./docs/integrations/agent-compat.md)
- **Shim mode** *(deprecated in v4.2; removal scheduled for v5.x)*. The original "no HTTP hop" path that patched `globalThis.fetch` inside a `dario shim -- <cmd>` child process. Empirically only matches 3 of the 8 wire-shape axes the billing classifier inspects (system blocks, agent identity, header order) and falls back to total passthrough when the client sends a 1-block system — which `claude -p` and Agent-SDK both do. Use **proxy mode** for any non-CC client; that's the only mode that rebuilds every request to CC's full canonical shape. Shim emits a deprecation banner on every invocation. See [CHANGELOG v4.2.0](./CHANGELOG.md) for the side-by-side fingerprint diff that drove this call.
- **Recover output capability.** `dario proxy --system-prompt=partial` strips CC's tone/verbosity/no-comments constraints for 1.2–2.8× more output on open-ended work — empirically without flipping billing (the classifier doesn't read that slot). [Discussion #183](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/183) has the per-prompt receipts. → [`docs/system-prompt.md`](./docs/system-prompt.md)
- **Reachable from inside CC / any MCP client.** `dario subagent install` registers a CC sub-agent for in-session diagnostics; `dario mcp` exposes dario as a read-only MCP server. → [`docs/sub-agent.md`](./docs/sub-agent.md) · [`docs/mcp-server.md`](./docs/mcp-server.md)
- **Active overage protection (v4.1).** Halts the proxy on any `representative-claim: overage` response and returns 503 to subsequent requests until you run `dario resume` or the cooldown clears. Visibility-only mode (`--overage-behavior=warn`) for operators who want the signal without disrupting traffic. Halt state visible in TUI Status/Hits/Analytics tabs, surfaced as named SSE events, and as a best-effort native desktop notification. [#288](https://github.com/askalf/dario/issues/288).

## Who it's for

**Best fit:** developers juggling multiple LLM tools and per-tool API keys · Claude Pro/Max subscribers who want their plan usable everywhere, not just in Claude Code · teams running local/hosted OpenAI-compat servers who want one stable local endpoint · Agent SDK users who want OAuth-subscription routing with zero code change (`baseURL: 'http://localhost:3456'`) · power users wanting multi-account pooling + 429 failover on their own machine.

**Not a fit:** you need vendor-managed production SLAs (use the provider APIs) · you want a hosted, multi-tenant team platform with dashboard / SSO / audit logs (that's coming — the [askalf platform](https://askalf.org) is in active development, shipping soon) · you want a chat UI (use claude.ai).

## FAQ

**Does this violate Anthropic's terms?**
Mechanically, dario uses your existing Claude Code OAuth tokens — it authenticates you as you, with your subscription, through Anthropic's official endpoints. Whether any particular use complies with current terms is between you and Anthropic; consult their terms and your agreement. Independent, unofficial, third-party — see [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md).

**What does the v4 TUI actually do?**
Open `dario` with no args. Six tabs: **Status** shows proxy health + OAuth expiry + config source + overage-guard state (v4.1: halt banner with countdown + `R` to resume); **Config** edits `~/.dario/config.json` in place (bool toggles inline, numbers/strings open a prompt, `s` saves); **Analytics** polls `/analytics` every 2s and renders per-model bars + rate-limit utilization + an Overage bar that's red the moment count is non-zero (v4.1); **Hits** subscribes to `/analytics/stream` SSE for the live request feed with per-record detail drilldown and a pinned halt banner when overage is detected (v4.1); **Accounts** lists the pool; **Backends** lists OpenAI-compat backends. Pure ANSI, zero new runtime deps. Migration from v3: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

**What if a request lands in `overage` despite the wire-shape replay?**
v4.1+ halts the proxy on the first overage response and returns 503 to subsequent requests until you investigate. See [What dario does when overage lands](#what-dario-does-when-overage-lands-v41). The TUI Status tab shows the triggering request + countdown to auto-resume; `dario resume` from any shell clears the halt immediately; `--overage-behavior=warn` switches to visibility-only mode if you'd rather see the signal than block traffic.

**Do I need Claude Code installed?**
Recommended, not required. With CC, `dario login` picks up credentials automatically and the live template extractor reads your binary on every startup. Without it, dario runs its own OAuth flow and falls back to the bundled (scrubbed) template snapshot.

**Do I need Bun?**
Optional, recommended — Bun's TLS ClientHello matches CC's runtime. Without it dario works fine; `dario doctor` flags the mismatch and `--strict-tls` hard-fails until resolved.

**Can I use dario without a Claude subscription?**
Yes. Skip `dario login`, `dario backend add openai --key=…`, and you have a local OpenAI-compat router with no Claude involvement.

**`representative-claim: seven_day` in my rate-limit headers — am I downgraded?**
No. `five_hour` and `seven_day` are both subscription billing — different accounting buckets, same mode. `overage` is the one that flips you to per-token. [Discussion #1](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/1).

**Will the 2026-06-15 split break my dario setup?**
No — see [The deadline](#the-deadline-2026-06-15) above. dario rewrites every request to interactive-CC shape before it reaches `api.anthropic.com`; the classifier sees interactive CC, not `claude -p`/Agent SDK, regardless of the local tool.

**What if Anthropic ships another silent change tomorrow?**
The three-class drift watcher picks it up — npm-release changes hourly on a github-hosted runner, in-version remote-config changes every 30 min on a self-hosted runner with real CC, classifier-rule changes via a daily live canary. Class A auto-drafts + auto-merges; Class B auto-rebakes the bundled template and opens a PR with a unified diff inline; Class C opens a labeled alert with diagnosis hints. v3.38.5 + v3.38.6 (13 min apart, same-day fix for v2.1.142's silent drops) and v4.2.1's same-binary remote-config receipts are the prior art. The TUI's Hits tab shows you the request shape in real time, so you'll see drift the moment it happens on your machine.

## Be part of the receipt log

Anthropic doesn't publish a wire-level changelog for subscribers. The dario repo is the closest thing that exists. Every silent change Anthropic ships, the drift watcher catches; every fix dario ships, the public record gets longer. That accumulating record is what makes the asymmetry visible to the next subscriber who can't explain why their burn rate spiked.

How to contribute to that record:

- **Star the repo.** GitHub stars are the most legible public signal that this matters. If you've felt the burn-rate spike, the rejection from extra-usage you didn't sign up for, the 1M context yanked from your plan with no notice — a star is the cheapest receipt to file.
- **Install + run.** Every active install is one more subscriber routing their already-paid-for plan through their own infrastructure instead of through whatever the next silent change does.
- **Run a pool.** Two accounts in `~/.dario/accounts/`, headroom-aware routing, 429 failover. Subscriptions are designed for one user; pool mode makes them resilient.
- **File drift.** Open an issue when your rate-limit header flips, when a tool you used yesterday breaks today, when a CC release lands without a wire-level note. We document it in public alongside the fix.
- **Share the install line.** Slack channel, group chat, the next Cursor/Aider/Cline user who's quietly paying their second bill. Pricing-aware proxying is a baseline subscriber capability, not a privilege.

Follow [@ask_alf](https://x.com/ask_alf) for drift bulletins as they happen. The [askalf platform](https://askalf.org) — a self-hosted AI workforce that builds on dario — is shipping soon.
